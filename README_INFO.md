MicroServices info
===

ChatGPT:

> Microservices architecture is made up of very small and completely independent software components, called microservices, that specialize and focus on one task only. Microservices communicate through APIs, which are rules that developers create to let other software systems communicate with their microservice.

> Microservices architecture is an evolution of the SOA architectural style. Microservices address the shortcomings of SOA to make the software more compatible with modern cloud-based enterprise environments. They are fine grained and favor data duplication as opposed to data sharing. This makes them completely independent with their own communication protocols that are exposed through lightweight APIs. Itâ€™s essentially the consumers' job to use the microservice through its API, thus removing the need for a centralized ESB.

> AWS is a great place to build modern applications with modular architectural patterns, serverless operational models, and agile development processes. It offers the most complete platform for building highly available microservices to power modern applications of any scope and scale. 

For example, you can do the following:

* Build, isolate, and run secure microservices in managed containers to simplify operations and reduce management overhead.
* Use AWS Lambda to run your microservices without provisioning and managing servers.
* Choose from 15 relational and non-relational purpose-built AWS databases to support microservices architecture.
* Easily monitor and control microservices running on AWS with AWS App Mesh.
* Monitor and troubleshoot complex microservice interactions with AWS X-Ray.


## MicroServices and NodeJS

Node.js has become a popular language for enterprises and startups who want to embrace microservices. There are several reasons why:

- Improved execution time - The V8 JavaScript engine that powers Node.js compiles functions written in JavaScript to native machine code. This makes Node.js a popular choice for building microservices that carry out low-latency CPU and IO-intensive operations.
- Event-driven architecture - Most of the objects in Node.js provide a way to emit and listen to events making it highly beneficial in building event-driven apps.
- Asynchronous and non-batch - Most Node.js libraries support non-blocking calls which continue execution without waiting for the previous call to return. Additionally, data is returned as-is, streamed as chunks, and not batched in a buffer.
- Scalable technology - The Node.js execution model supports scaling by delegating request handling to other worker threads.

### Saga Pattern

https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html

> A saga is a sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates the database and publishes a message or event to trigger the next local transaction in the saga. If a local transaction fails because it violates a business rule then the saga executes a series of compensating transactions that undo the changes that were made by the preceding local transactions.

There are two ways of coordination sagas:

- Choreography - each local transaction publishes domain events that trigger local transactions in other services
- Orchestration - an orchestrator (object) tells the participants what local transactions to execute

> The Saga design pattern is a way to manage data consistency across microservices in distributed transaction scenarios. A saga is a sequence of transactions that updates each service and publishes a message or event to trigger the next transaction step. If a step fails, the saga executes compensating transactions that counteract the preceding transactions.


In multiservices architectures:

- `Atomicity` is an indivisible and irreducible set of operations that must all occur or none occur.
- `Consistency` means the transaction brings the data only from one valid state to another valid state.
- `Isolation` guarantees that concurrent transactions produce the same data state that sequentially executed transactions would have produced.
- `Durability` ensures that committed transactions remain committed even in case of system failure or power outage.

> The main benefit of the Saga Pattern is that it helps maintain data consistency across multiple services without tight coupling. This is an extremely important aspect for a microservices architecture.

> However, the main disadvantage of the Saga Pattern is the apparent complexity from a programming point of view. Also, developers are not as well accustomed to writing Sagas as traditional transactions. The other challenge is that compensating transactions also have to be designed to make Sagas work.


## Redis - as EventBus aka Queue Management aka Messages Broker

ChatGPT:

- When ServerApp makes a request to ServiceA or ServiceB, include the necessary information in the request.
- Alternatively, you can directly communicate with the Redis container from ServerApp and let ServiceA and ServiceB consume the messages.
- Considerations:
  - This approach decouples ServiceA, ServiceB, and ServerApp, allowing them to communicate asynchronously.
  - If you want ServiceA and ServiceB to respond to requests from ServerApp, you might need a request-response pattern.
